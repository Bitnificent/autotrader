WHAT'S IT
==========


A set of script for you to trade any financial product in market, for now I only test on future index product.

we follow kiss(Keep It Simple & Stupid) rule. 

We try to have an Easy Language like trading environment (Trade Station), 

that let people don't have to learn too much. 

Keeping every function tiny, easy, and small not easy to break down the trading system, and easy to understand.


Just for you to test or some other developer interested in this field.




HOW-TO
==========

For developer you should have Python environment, most Linux distribution had installed, on Windows you can download it at http://www.python.org/ , pywin32 http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/ 


In the near future we release the windows executable binary(.exe file) for download.

autotrader.py -m TFX.csv strategy.py
    
    this will fire you strategy to test the default period of market data


autotrader.py --pov=200 --tax=1000 --start=2009-09-01 -m TFX.csv strategy.py

    this will fire you strategy to test from 2009-09-01 of market data to end, 

    pov mean Point of Value, tax  mean, how much will cost per trade, you must have pov and tax at the same time
